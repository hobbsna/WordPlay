    <!--Explanation of best practices for using the prompt pickers -->
    <p class="m-4">You've decided on a writing style and you've found your voice, so now it's time to write! Right? No? What do you mean you don't have any ideas? Okay, so this isn't a "lesson" in the traditional sense, but it can be very helpful for those who get stuck. The way this is going to work is pretty straightforward: I, the author of this site, am going to provide you with some prompts sorted by the three main writing styles (which, in case you forgot, are Prose/Fiction, Poetry, and Nonfiction.) Then you, the reader of this site, are going to select one that suits you and have at it! 15 minutes ought to do it! Once you finish that one, you can always come back for more later! Now you can't use the "I don't have ideas" excuse anymore! On your mark, get set, go! Happy writing!</p>
