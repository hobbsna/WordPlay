    <h3 class="m-4">Prose</h3>
    <p class="m-4">There are many ways to classify writing. For prose (fiction) writing, one method is to use word length. Here are some of the more common categories.</p>

    <!--Brief Listing of writing types-->
    <div class="list-group">
        <a href="#" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-success">Flash Fiction: 1,000 words or less. Great for writing warm-ups and can easily be accomplished in one sitting.</a>
        <a href="#" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-light">Short Stories: 1,000-7,500 words. These often appear in magazines. Many professional writers started their careers with short stories.</a>
        <a href="#" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-light">Novelette: 7,500-20,000 words. Can be difficult to sell to a print publisher, but great for publishing online.</a>
        <a href="#" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-light">Novella: 20,000-50,000 words. A popular length for the e-publishing market.</a>
        <a href="#" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-light">Novel: 50,000-110,000 words. Young Adult (YA) novels tend to be on the shorter range of the spectrum, but not always.</a>
        <a href="#" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-light">Epic: Over 110,000 words. This generally only works for people who have contracts with traditional publishers.</a>
    </div>

    <p class="m-4">Another classification is by genre, a category of artisitc composition characterized by similarities in form, style, or subject matter. Many stories incorporate several genres. Below is a listing of a few of the more common forms. Click on a picture to explore more.</p>

    <em class="m-4">Everything is proceeding as I have forseen</em><br>

    <h3 class="m-4">Nonfiction</h3>

    <!--Nonfiction categories-->
    <h4 class="m-4">Expository</h4>
    <p class="m-4">This style seeks to inform and educate readers without expressing opinions. Facts, statistics, and data are going to be necessary, as well as citations. This is not a place to try to influence the reader. Examples of expository nonfiction include how-to books, textbooks, cookbooks, and instruction manuals.</p>

    <h4 class="m-4">Descriptive</h4>
    <p class="m-4">The goal with this writing style is to engage the audience's senses and feelings. The reader should feel like they are there with you. This style is not used to narrate. Some examples include novels, poetry, and music lyrics.</p>

    <h4 class="m-4">Narrative</h4>
    <p class="m-4">This style seeks to offer insight into the thoughts and feelings of characters. Narrative writing can be used very effectively in problem-solving nonficton. It is not used to introduce facts nor to persuade an audience. Some examples include poetry, short stories, novels, and screenplays.</p>

    <h4 class="m-4">Persuasive</h4>
    <p class="m-4">This goal of this style is to convince the reader to take action and implement your solution. You'll need to appeal to them on an emotional level, showing your credibility throughout. This is not used for anything outside reality. Common examples include academic papers, opinion pieces, and editorials.</p>
