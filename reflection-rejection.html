    <p class="m-4">If you put your work out there for others to see it, it will be rejected by someone. Period. There's no way around it. Even the mostly widely acclaimed stories have their detractors. It's part of the hardship of being an artist. This lesson is not about that type of rejection. This lesson is about using the rejection of critics to strengthen your work. If your work is continusously being rejected, you might just be on to something big. The most sucessful writers of all time were repeatedly rejected before they became established. Let's take a look at a few key case-study worthy examples.</p>

    <h3 class="m-4">George Lucas</h3>
    <p class="m-4">Now seen as a visionary way who was way ahead of his time, the creator of <em>Star Wars</em> faced numerous rejections before eventually being allowed to join the billionaires club. Very few believed in his work. Conceived as a space opera/space western, "The Star Wars" was proposed as a modern take on Flash Gordon. All but one studio turned his work down. The one? 20th Century Fox. And only because Alan Ladd, Jr. liked George's work on <em>American Graffiti.</em> Alan Ladd, Jr. was able to force through a production and distribution deal, but that was not the end of Lucas's troubles.</p>

    <p class="m-4">By all rights, <em>Star Wars</em> should have never been produced. The logistics were a nightmare. Extremely hot desert conditions made working on the set a nightmare. Sound stages broke. Models fell apart. Most of the actors (except Alec Guiness) didn't take their roles very seriously most of the time. And to top it off, the timing of the movie couldn't have been worse. People heard "war" and thought of Vietnam, which ended just a few years previously. They were also condfused by the star part of the title. Prior to Star Wars, Science Fiction wasn't a popular genre for the screen. Most people thought of "star" as Hollywood, which created even greater confusion.</p>

    <p class="m-4">The only reason Star Wars became successful was George's determination. He had a vision and he was going to see it through, no matter what it took. No matter how many times he was rejected. No matter the cost.</p>

    <h3 class="m-4">Stephen King</h3>

    <p class="m-4">The King of Horror. Known for writing stories like <em>It</em>, <em>The Shining</em>, <em>Carrie</em>, and <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em> just to name a few, Stephen King is an extremely popular novelist. But it wasn't always that way. Stephen King started writing short stories at 12, without success. He published his first story at 18 in a magazine called <em>Comics Review.</em> His early stories never earned him much money and he was rejected repeatedly, but he kept at it and he kept practicing.</p>

    <p class="m-4">In his memoir <em>On Writing</em>, Stephen King has a quote that says that at 14 “The nail in my wall would no longer support the weight of the rejection slips impaled upon it. I replaced the nail with a spike and kept on writing.”</p>

    <p class="m-4"><em>Carrie</em>, his first novel, was published in 1974 and became a huge success, rocketing him to stardom.</p>

    <h3 class="m-4">J.K. Rowling</h3>

    <p class="m-4">Harry Potter is one of the most popular fantasy stories of all time and the reason why J.K. Rowling is one of the most famous authors of the twenty first century. Nowadays, she's worth close to a billion dollars.</p>

    <p class="m-4">Prior to penning <em>Harry Potter</em>, Rowling was a single mom on welfare. She worked a series of temp jobs after college graduation when her mother died of multiple sclerosis at 45. Rowling later desccribed herself as being "as poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless." In 1995 she completed <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</em>, and started trying to get noticed. At the time, nobody seemed to recognize what the story would become, as she recieved a <em>dozen</em> rejections before finding a taker in London publishing house Bloomsbury.</p>

    <p class="m-4">On June 26, 1997, <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</em> was finally published. She became a billionaire in less than ten years after it was published.</p>

    <h3 class="m-4">Dr Seuss</h3>

    <p class="m-4">The writer of many of the most popular children's books of all time, Dr Seuss sold over 600 million copies which have been trasnlated into more than 20 langugages.</p>
    
    <p class="m-4">Guess how many times he was rejected by publishers? <em>Twenty-seven.</em> After the 27th, he decided to go home and burn his manuscript.</p>
    
    <p class="m-4">Before he made it home, though, he ran into an old school acquanitance who asked what he was carrying. Seuss told him about his frustrations, but the friend happened to be an editor himself. He insisted on reading the manuscript and declared that he would publish it himself.</p>
    
    <p class="m-4">Everything would have been different if he hadn't found a lucky break.</p>

    <p class="m-4">The important takeaway is that rejection is a normal part of the writing process. Keep trying. Something is bound to happen.</p>
