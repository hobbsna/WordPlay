    <p class="m-4">You have the tools. Now it's time to keep going and see just what you can do. Practice = progression. Repeat after me: Practice + Practice = More progression. Practice + Practice * Practice = Fantastic progression.</p>

    <p class="m-4">Here are some suggestions to make the most of your practice time:</p>

    <!--This might also be a good place to do something creative with hiding and showing content -->

    <p class="m-4">Build a habit. If you can find a specific and duration to write everyday, you will be much more likely to actually do it.</p>

    <p class="m-4">Eliminate distractions. Noise cancelling headphones are awesome for this. The quieter and more focused your time is, the better of you will be.</p>

    <p class="m-4">Take things in chunks. If you get stuck on one section, set it aside and work on another part. It's totally okay to take things nonlinearally if it helps you get everything out of your head.</p>

    <p class="m-4">Set a word limit for yourself. Until you've produced x number of words, it's not time to stop yet. (Start small and gradually increase)</p>

    <p class="m-4">Find a writing buddy! Two heads is always better than one! This can be fun because you can have someone to share your work with when you're finished!</p>

    <p class="m-4">And if you really want accountability, join a writing club! There's lots of other people out there just like you!</p>
