    <p class="m-4">The conception phase is all about finding ideas. The first few minutes tend to be a lot of fun, but at somepoint, you're likely to get stuck. The objective of the progression phase is to keep making progress, even when things get difficult. This is the meat of writing - All writer's spend the bulk of their time in this phase. The other two phases are like buns that hold everything together. As a result, this phase is generally the most challenging, but can also be the most rewarding.</p>

    <h3 class="m-4">So, what is writer's block exactly?</h3>

    <p class="m-4">There's this common misconception that writer's block is not having any ideas. That's a completely wrong way to think about writer's block. There's a big difference between not having <em>any</em> ideas, and not having <em>any idea</em> what to do with your ideas. That is the essence of writer's block. A true writer is going to have many great ideas; connecting them is generally going to be the tricky part.</p>

    <h3 class="m-4">Strategies for overcoming writer's block:</h3>

    <!--Potentially put a collapse in a card so you can see the short version and expand into the long version.-->

    <p class="m-4">Take a break and go for a walk. Seriously. The break will help take your mind off the writing, letting you enjoy other aspects of life. Frequently ideas come to as when we least expect it (and generally at really inconveinent times, like when you're trying to sleep or taking a shower). Additionally, the excercise stimulates blood flow to the brain, which is never a bad thing!</p>

    <p class="m-4">Listen to music. Inspiration takes place in the wildest of forms. I don't know if there's any scientific evidence here, but I've found that listening to music makes me feel supercharged and capable of anything. I hardly ever write without listening to something.</p>
